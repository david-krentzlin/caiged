.SH SHELL BEHAVIOR
The
.B shell
subcommand connects to the container's shell (default: /bin/zsh) for debugging and maintenance tasks. This is different from the
.B caiged connect
command which connects to the OpenCode TUI client.
.SH STOP-ALL BEHAVIOR
The
.B stop-all
subcommand forcefully removes all caiged containers using
.BR "docker rm -f" .
This will terminate all running OpenCode sessions. Use with caution as unsaved work may be lost.
